### Note: This reading group does no longer run. With sufficient interest we can bring this back. Feel free to email us if you want this to come back. 

Ethical use and development of AI is one of the core values UVic AI seeks to promote. Visit [our ethics channel](https://discord.com/channels/667187914781884421/979147716879872130) on discord for links and discussion on ethics topics. Visit [our announcements channel](https://discord.com/channels/667187914781884421/1023737863407407194) for upcoming AI Ethics events including online meetings and in person events on campus.


<ins>Reading Group</ins>

We have been hosting a reading group since the summer of 2023 focusing on AI safety research, including value alignment, interpretability, AI governance, and societal impact. You can view a list of our topics below, and browse [our reading-group channel](https://discord.com/channels/667187914781884421/1107810310963855461) to view our notes from each session.
